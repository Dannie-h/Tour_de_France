# Tour_de_France
Tour de France, an iconic cycle event, has captivated the world since 1903. The annual race, rich with history and tradition, showcases the sheer determination of world class athletes.

Tour de France goes beyond physical endurance – it’s a test of willpower and mental strength. It pushes riders to their limits, challenging them to overcome unforgivable mountains and unpredictable weather conditions.

Its ultimate prize is the prestigious yellow jersey – awarded to the overall winner. Tour de France, extends, however, beyond this: some riders focus on the green jersey aiming to become the best sprinter and dominate flat stages; other seek to overcome steep inclines to be crowned King of the Mountains while others will sacrifice their own ambitions for the collective success of the team.

The race itself is a captivating spectacle filled with unforgettable moments. From breathtaking descends with speeds that exceed 100km/h to memorable attacks and daring breakaways, Tour de France delivers excitement with every stage. And who can forget the sight of Chris Froome running up Mount Ventoux after a bike malfunction, only to emerge victorious in the general classification.

Two of the cycling superstars who have dominated the last editions of the Tour are this year’s favourites: Jonas Vingegaard and Tadej Pogacar. But rest assured, the tour is full of surprises, and you never know what can happen! Join this year’s Tour de France where physical power merges with unwavering determination as riders rely on strategic decisions that can make or break their chances of victory.



### Dataset: 
For this project I used the dataset provided by Maven Analytics which contained historical data about the tour, capturing details about winners, stages and other relevant attributes.

 
 ### Project Overview: 
In this project I explored the world of Tour de France. Through data analysis, and storytelling I celebrated the extraordinary achievements and paid tribute to the enduring legacy of this iconic event.
  
  ### Tools:
  MS Power BI
  
  ### Project Steps:
  #### 1.	I imported the Tour de France dataset consisting of four tables into PowerBI, ensuring all relevant tables were properly connected.
  
  #### 2. Data cleaning and preparation
To ensure data consistency and validity, I performed data cleaning and preparation tasks using Power Query. This involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and resolving any data quality issues.

 
 #### 3. Data exploration
- I explored the dataset using various techniques like summary statistics, and visualizations to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data and identify patterns and trends.
- I created relevant calculated columns and measures to capture important aspects of the data and facilitate further analysis. These calculations included aggregations, comparisons, and derived metrics to provide deeper insights into the Tour de France.
  
#### 4. Data visualization
I focused on creating clear and easy to follow visualizations to clearly communicate my findings.

Legend: the yellow jersey is offered to the overall leader of the race
-	The green jersey (best sprinter) is offered to the rider who wins most points at sprints. In this visual I used it to emphasize the rider with most sprint wins.
-	The polka dot jersey (king of the mountains) is offered to the rider with most points accumulated at the top of the climbs throughout the Tour. In this visual I used it to emphasize the rider with most mountain wins.
-	The white jersey (best young rider) – is offered to riders aged 25 and under who record the best time overall in the race. In this visual I used it to emphasize the youngest rider to ever win the tour.

  
#### Key findings: 
-	There is a clear dominance of French riders in the Tour de France with notable names like Bernard Hinault and Jacques Anquetil both holding five overall titles. Belgium is a strong contender with the famous Eddie Merckx also conquering the general classification 5 times.
-	The specialization of riders in different stage type can be noted with sprinters like Mark Cavendish winning an astonishing 34 flat stages. He shares the title for most stage wins in Tour de France with Eddie Merckx, an all-rounded rider who won 12 mountain stages.
-	The importance of mental strength and strategic planning added to physical endurance is highlighted by the average age of riders. It is a sport where riders typically achieve their victories in the middle or lates stages of their careers. Surprises do occur: Henri Cornet won his title when he was only 20 years old.
-	Individual Time Trials can be a determining factor in the overall outcome, as evidenced by the success of riders like Bernard Hinault.
-	Winning the tour de France also require good skills while riding an individual time trial as shown by Bernard Hinault who won 20 of such stages.
-	Analyzing the stage profile reveals that approximately half of the Tour consists of flat stages, providing an opportunity for sprinters to showcase their skills. However, the intense competition for the yellow jersey predominantly unfolds in mountainous terrains, making mountain stages the second most common type.
-	The tour has evolved over the years: with shorter distances and higher average speeds. The longest tour was in 1926 with more than 5700 km! The average speeds almost doubled:
from 25.5 km/h in 1903 to 41.80 km/h in the most recent event. This reflects the advancements in technology, training methods, and road infrastructure. 
-	The number of participants also suffered changes: in 1903 only 21 out of the 60 entrants finished the race! The numbers, as well as the completion rate increased over time.
-	The Tour has an international reach, extending beyond France to neighbouring countries adding excitement to the race.




I'm excited about what this year's race has got to offer: 176 riders will depart from Bilbao on 2nd July. With 8 mountain stages and 4 summits, the 110th edition will be a treat!
